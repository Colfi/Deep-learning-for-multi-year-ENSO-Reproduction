## Desciption

This is the project to reproduce Ham et al. 2019's work.

The first version was finished in 2020. (Also it can be looked in ./old)

In 2022, I rewrite all the codes and use **Tensorflow** to finish all the work.

Hoping to help you.

## Data

If you don't want to download CMIP data and meteorological data, you can use the meteorological data in the **./data** folder. 

The [data](./data) in **./data** folder is processed according to the original paper (Ham et al. 2019). How to use the data can refer to [load_data.py](./code/load_data.py) and [Network.ipynb](./code/Network.ipynb) in the **./code** folder

## Information

See [Code_explaination.md](./Code_explaination.md) for a detailed explanation of the code

Tnanks for Prof. Jingjia Luo (NUIST), Prof. Lin Chen (NUIST) and Dr. Ming Sun (NUIST)'s guidance.

Also, Thank Dr. Sun Ming for providing CMIP data.
